/* We'll want more specific regarding pain-points on the main page One starting point here. But the FAQ can be integrated (pehraps by having the 2nd ul element have no icon)*/
Do you want to focuse on managing servers? Or on biological interpretation?




# FAQ

 - __Which version of SequenceServer does the cloud service use?__
   - We run the latest stable version (as of 2021-05-14, that is SequenceServer 2.0 release candidate 8). We continually roll out upgrades to benefit from sensitivity.
 - __Can I go back to a previous BLAST result?__
   - Yes the output of a BLAST search is retained at the stable URL - the https address at the top of the page. How long it is retained for depends on your usage tier. 
 - __Can I share my BLAST results?__
   - Yes, you can share the https URL at the top of the page with others. They currently need to also have access to your password-protected BLAST instance. Alternatively, you can save your BLAST report using the built-in functionality of your web browser (save as a PDF or as a Web archive). Additionally, you can easily export the raw data (in table or XML formats). Finally, all of the figures shown in the BLAST report can easily be downloaded in publication ready PNG or SVG formats.
 - __Do I need to enter my password every time I want to do a BLAST search?__
   - No - your web browser will remember your login/password combination.
 - __Can I have a free trial?__
   - We essentially have the equivalent of that: we offer a full 30 day money back guarantee, no questions asked. 
- __Do you take other payment mechanisms?__
   -  If payment by bank card doesn't work for you, please get in touch.
 - __Is the payment mechanism secure?__
   -  We take security extremely seriously. SequenceServer doesn't want or need your payment information. Instead, we process payments using the industry standard <a href="https://www.stripe.com">Stripe.com</a>. This is one of the most widely used online payment processing companies, which annually processes hundres of billions of dollars in payments. Other companies that also use stripe for payment processing include Kickstarter, Booking.com, Zoom, Uber, Deliveroo and Unicef.
- __I have other questions__
   - Feel free to contact us by <a href="mailto:sequenceserver@gmail.com">email</a>. We are also happy to arrange a demonstration or question/answer call over zoom.
