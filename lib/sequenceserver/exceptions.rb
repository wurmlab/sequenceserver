# This file defines all possible exceptions that can be thrown by
# SequenceServer on startup.
#
# Exceptions only ever inform another entity (downstream code or users) of an
# issue. Exceptions may or may not be recoverable.
#
# Error classes should be seen as: the error code (class name), human readable
# message (to_s method), and necessary attributes to act on the error.
#
# We define as many error classes as needed to be precise about the issue, thus
# making it easy for downstream code (bin/sequenceserver or config.ru) to act
# on them.

  ## ENOENT ##

  # Name borrowed from standard Errno::ENOENT, this class serves as a template
  # for defining errors that mean "expected to find <entity> at <path>, but
  # didn't".
  #
  # ENOENT is raised if and only if an entity was set, either using CLI or
  # config file. For instance, it's compulsory to set database_dir. But ENOENT
  # is not raised if database_dir is not set. ENOENT is raised if database_dir
  # was set, but does not exist.

      <<~MSG
        BLAST+ is either not installed, or there is a problem with the

  # system but not meeting SequenceServer's minimum version requirement.
