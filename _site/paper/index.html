<h2>Abstract</h2>
                    <div class="abstract"><p>Comparing newly obtained and previously known nucleotide and amino-acid sequences underpins modern biological research. BLAST is a well-established tool for such comparisons but is challenging to use on new data sets. We combined a user-centric design philosophy with sustainable software development approaches to create Sequenceserver, a tool for running BLAST and visually inspecting BLAST results for biological interpretation. Sequenceserver uses simple algorithms to prevent potential analysis errors and provides flexible text-based and visual outputs to support researcher productivity. Our software can be rapidly installed for use by individuals or on shared servers.</p></div>

<h2  id="186351738" class="section-title js-splitscreen-section-title" >Introduction</h2>
<p>The dramatic drop in sequencing costs has created many opportunities for individuals and groups of researchers to generate genomic or transcriptomic sequences from previously understudied organisms. Many research questions require small- or large-scale sequence comparisons, and BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) is the most established tool for many such analyses (<span class="xrefLink" id="jumplink-msz185-B1"></span><a href="javascript:;" reveal-id="msz185-B1" data-open="msz185-B1" class="link link-ref link-reveal xref-bibr">Altschul et al. 1990</a>; <span class="xrefLink" id="jumplink-msz185-B4"></span><a href="javascript:;" reveal-id="msz185-B4" data-open="msz185-B4" class="link link-ref link-reveal xref-bibr">Camacho et al. 2009</a>). Unfortunately, BLAST analysis of new data can be challenging. There are delays before new data are submitted to and become publicly available on central BLAST repositories such as the NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information), and only small queries are feasible on such repositories. BLAST can be downloaded and installed locally, but its usage can be challenging for researchers without experience of command-line interfaces. Finally, commercial software to overcome such hurdles is too costly for many laboratories.</p><p>Here, we present Sequenceserver, a free graphical interface for BLAST designed to increase the productivity of biologist researchers performing and interpreting BLAST searches on custom data sets, and of bioinformaticians setting up shared laboratory or community databases. It has a user-centric focus (<span class="xrefLink" id="jumplink-msz185-B6"></span><a href="javascript:;" reveal-id="msz185-B6" data-open="msz185-B6" class="link link-ref link-reveal xref-bibr">Garrett 2011</a>) on accompanying researchers through their work process. Below, we provide an overview of Sequenceserver features that facilitate BLAST query submission and interpretation.</p>                    <h2  id="186351741" class="section-title js-splitscreen-section-title" >Assisted Installation and BLAST Query Submission</h2>
<p>Installing Sequenceserver on computers running macOS or Linux is typically rapid, requiring only one or few commands (see online documentation). If necessary, Sequenceserver automates the download of BLAST (<span class="xrefLink" id="jumplink-msz185-B4"></span><a href="javascript:;" reveal-id="msz185-B4" data-open="msz185-B4" class="link link-ref link-reveal xref-bibr">Camacho et al. 2009</a>) binaries and can manage the conversion of FASTA files to BLAST databases. A user accesses Sequenceserver’s graphical interface in a web browser at <a class="link link-uri openInAnotherWindow" href="http://localhost:4567" target="_blank">http://localhost:4567</a> (<span class="xrefLink" id="jumplink-msz185-F1"></span><a href="javascript:;" reveal-id="msz185-F1" data-open="msz185-F1" class="link link-reveal link-table xref-fig">fig. 1A</a>). All detected BLAST databases are automatically listed here. The user types, pastes or drag-and-drops FASTA format query sequences into a text-field (<span class="xrefLink" id="jumplink-msz185-F1"></span><a href="javascript:;" reveal-id="msz185-F1" data-open="msz185-F1" class="link link-reveal link-table xref-fig">fig. 1A</a>). To prevent common errors, an alert message is shown and query submission is disabled if the query is invalid (e.g., combining nucleotide and protein sequences). The user then selects databases. The appropriate basic BLAST algorithm will automatically be used (<span class="link link-data-supplement" data-supplement-target="sup1"></span><span class="content-section supplementary-material"><a path-from-xml="sup1" href="blast-interface-design-and-implementation.html">supplementary fig. S1</a></span>, <span class="link link-data-supplement" data-supplement-target="sup1"></span><span class="content-section supplementary-material"><a path-from-xml="sup1" href="blast-interface-design-and-implementation.html">Supplementary Material</a></span> online). When multiple algorithms are appropriate, a pull-down in the BLAST submission button allows the user to toggle between them. An “advanced parameters” field provides access to all standard BLAST parameters. </p>                        <a id="186351743" scrollto-destination="186351743"></a>

      <p>The Sequenceserver results page is designed to facilitate navigation, interpretation, and follow-up analysis (<span class="xrefLink" id="jumplink-msz185-F1"></span><a href="javascript:;" reveal-id="msz185-F1" data-open="msz185-F1" class="link link-reveal link-table xref-fig">fig. 1B</a> and <a class="link link-uri openInAnotherWindow" href="https://sequenceserver.com/paper/resultsinteractive" target="_blank">https://sequenceserver.com/paper/resultsinteractive</a>; last accessed August 25, 2018). Results are visually structured and will feel familiar to users of NCBI BLAST. If multiple query sequences were submitted, a clickable index of queries is shown. Queries, hits, and BLAST HSPs (high-scoring segment pairs) are numbered to facilitate navigation. For each query, identified hits are summarized in a table and an overview graphic. Each hit includes links for FASTA download, sequence visualization, and potentially to other resources. Such links can be automatically added based on regular expression analysis of identifiers (see online documentation). BLAST results can be downloaded in XML or tab-delimited table formats for further analysis. Similarly, a FASTA file containing all hit sequences, or a selection of hit sequences can be downloaded.</p>                    <h2  id="186351746" class="section-title js-splitscreen-section-title" >Usage by Individual Researchers and as Part of Community Databases</h2>

Additionally, many password-protected Sequenceserver instances exist for unpublished data.</p>                    <h2  id="186351749" class="section-title js-splitscreen-section-title" >Outlook</h2>
<p>In creating Sequenceserver, we aimed to respect user-centric design principles, open-source, and sustainable software engineering practices (<span class="link link-data-supplement" data-supplement-target="sup1"></span><span class="content-section supplementary-material"><a path-from-xml="sup1" href="blast-interface-design-and-implementation.html">Supplementary Material</a></span> online). Our software is built using Ruby and Javascript frameworks commonly used for professional software development. The resulting robust architecture and flexibility facilitate customization and integration with other tools. This has led to contributions of improvements and bug-fixes by 21 bioinformaticians unrelated to the initial project; many are now coauthors. Our community is testing the ability to import preexisting BLAST or DIAMOND XML result files (<span class="xrefLink" id="jumplink-msz185-B3"></span><a href="javascript:;" reveal-id="msz185-B3" data-open="msz185-B3" class="link link-ref link-reveal xref-bibr">Buchfink et al. 2015</a>), and new manners of visualizing results (<span class="xrefLink" id="jumplink-msz185-B15"></span><a href="javascript:;" reveal-id="msz185-B15" data-open="msz185-B15" class="link link-ref link-reveal xref-bibr">Wintersinger and Wasmuth 2015</a>; <span class="xrefLink" id="jumplink-msz185-B5"></span><a href="javascript:;" reveal-id="msz185-B5" data-open="msz185-B5" class="link link-ref link-reveal xref-bibr">Cui et al. 2016</a>). Such efforts will continue to improve the ability of researchers to analyze and interpret genomic data.</p>                    <h2  id="186351751" class="section-title js-splitscreen-section-title" >Data Availability</h2>
