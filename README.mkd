# SequenceServer (Beta 1)

Biologists constantly generate new sequence data. However, it is challenging to effectively 
share and search and compare sequence data. Deploying complex solutions such as
[GMOD][5] is often overkill, and publicly available front ends for BLAST such as 
[NCBI's wwwblast][21] are difficult to use or install. 
There is a need for an easy-to-deploy and easy-to-use solution.

SequenceServer allows rapid creation of a web page to [BLAST][1] search 
sequence databases by using an intuitive user interface. SequenceServer can 
be used as a local point and click interface to [NCBI BLAST+][2], or to 
provide one over the web. SequenceServer uses [NCBI BLAST+][2], 
[Sinatra][3], and [jQuery][4].

## Features

Ease of use for biologists:

* a single iPod-like search page
* intuitive and helpful web interface: automatic sequence type detection that helps
  choose appropriate BLAST method and database types
* links to easily download sequences of BLAST hits
* support for advanced options.
  
  
Rapid deployment for bioinformatics administrators:

* assisted formatting of BLAST databases (with sequence type detection)
* automatic discovery of formatted BLAST databases during startup
* uses ruby's internal web server (on any open port) or Apache
* add custom hyperlinks to identified hits (to your genome browser or custom database)
* open source & freely available for non-profits.


## Setup

### Requirements

The following software is required to run SequenceServer:

* [NCBI BLAST+][2]  ( at least 2.2.18 )
* [Ruby][6]         ( tested with 1.8.7 and 1.9.2)

### Download

Get the latest version SequenceServer from: https://github.com/yannickwurm/sequenceserver/archives/master.

Or download the zip in the command-line:

    wget http://github.com/yannickwurm/sequenceserver/zipball/master
 

### Installation

Unzip/Untar the downloaded file, cd to SequenceServer's directory and issue the following command that will make sure you have the required ruby dependencies:

    gem install bundler && bundle install

### Either set up BLAST databases from a directory of FASTA sequence files

     ruby database_formatter.rb directory_with_fasta_files

The `database_formatter.rb` script will assist you by:

 * finding FASTA files in `directory_with_fasta_files` (and in subdirectories too)
 * detecting the sequence type of each file
 * asking you to name each database
 * subsequently running the appropriate `makeblastdb` commands.

### Or set up BLAST databases from a single FASTA sequence file
In the directory containing the FASTA file, run:
    
    makeblastdb -dbtype <db type> -title <db title> -in <db> -parse_seqids

Where,

* `<db type>` is either `prot`, or `nucl` depending on the type of sequence
* `<db title>` is what users will see
* `<db>` is the path to the FASTA file
* `-parse_seqids` is required to generate links for downloading search
  hits (yes, it's slow on large files).
* Additional options at `makeblastdb -help`.


### Configuration

SequenceServer needs to know the location of the BLAST+ binaries, and the
BLAST database. This is accomplished by providing a `config.yml` in the
installation directory.

    # .config.yml
    bin: ~/ncbi-blast-2.2.25+/bin/
    database: /Users/me/blast_databases/

A fully commented `example.config.yml` is provided for a start - copy it to
`config.yml`, edit the values, and start blasting!

## Running SequenceServer

From the installation directory, run:

    ruby sequenceserver.rb


SequenceServer will be accessible on port 4567 at http://localhost:4567/ . 
Change the port by editing `config.yml` or with the -p command line option, eg: `ruby sequenceserver.rb -p 8181`.
    
SequenceServer automatically uses ruby's internal web servers. No need for Apache. 
By default it uses [Webrick][7]. Installling [Thin][8] (`gem install thin`), or [Mongrel][9] (`gem install mongrel`) 
can improve performance. 

## Who uses SequenceServer?

* 'Beta 1' is deployed by the [Keller lab][10] at [University of
Lausanne][11]; see [Fourmidable Sequences][12].
* [Guy Leonard @ National History Museum London][13] 
* Steffen Lemke @ Center for Organismal Studies, Heidelberg. 
* Researchers at [Benaroya Research Institute at Virginia Mason][22]
* you...
